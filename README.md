# AIArtathon - Aligatou
This project aims to combains the Art with the Artifical Intallagece.  
Based on an artest needs, we in this project generated a new abstracts shapes that the artist can use in his artwork.
we succefully generated new shapes given a dataset of only four shapes (circle, square, star and triangle) 
The GAN structure were used.
To succefully see the output please check our colab version.
Additional to the generative model we used OpenCV to get the outliner of the givin shape.
